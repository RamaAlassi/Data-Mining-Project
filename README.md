# Data Mining Project – Forest Fire Prediction

This project applies data mining and statistical learning techniques to analyze and predict forest fire risk using environmental and meteorological data. The goal is to explore patterns associated with forest fires and evaluate different classification models for predictive performance.

---

## Project Overview
Forest fires pose significant environmental and economic risks. By analyzing historical data, this project aims to identify key factors influencing fire occurrence and compare multiple classification models to determine the most effective approach for prediction.

This project was developed as part of a **Data Mining course (Fall 2024)**.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains environmental and weather-related variables commonly associated with forest fire activity, such as:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind
- Rain
- Fire occurrence indicator

The data was preprocessed to ensure consistency, handle missing values, and prepare it for modeling.
